# hubitat-midea-dehumidifier

My "fork" of the Midea dehumidifier driver [posted here on the Hubitat
forum](https://community.hubitat.com/t/midea-dehumidifier/94473). Since
the original isn't on Github and I wanted to track my changes, I've put
them here.

Changes from upstream:

* Reports tank fill level

To Do:

* Publish actionable event when tank full
* Publish actionable event when filters need changing
